# HW_AC
This was the homework for the Computer Architecture course at UPB. Details for the homework tasks are available at https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/ac-is/teme/tema1. A more detailed explanation for how the Verilog modules work are present in the README.pdf. For the testing, Xillinx ISE 2014 is used, otherwise the verify scripts won't work.
